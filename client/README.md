AquaGenetics AI Labs (AGAC). It is a project based on aquaponics and hydroponics. AquaGenetics AI Labs (AGAC) focuses on integrating advanced AI technologies with aquaponics and genomics. Aquaponics works to optimize the symbiotic system of aquaculture (raising fish) and hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) to create sustainable food production. In genomics, AGAC applies AI-driven data analysis to understand genetic information, enhance breeding programs, and improve crop and livestock traits. The goal is to innovate in sustainable agriculture, food security, and environmental conservation through cutting-edge genetic research and intelligent system designs.
